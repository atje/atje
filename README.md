👋 Hi, I’m @atje
- 👀 I’m interested in home automation, visualizing process data, learning new things, solving problems. Did my first program in mid 80s, and have since explored more programming languages than I can remember (some of which have surely ceased to be used, like Basic, Pascal)
- Linux user since the early 90's, also was one of those guys tampering with OS/2 🤓

- 🌱 I’m an occasional developer who try not to suck when doing it too seldom
- Also cheating with Ardunio C++, CSS, Framework7 💞️ 
- Latest endeavor is to learn Go (golang) by using it to solve AoC puzzles (2022 & 2023)
