- 👋 Hi, I’m @atje
- 👀 I’m interested in home automation, visualizing process data, learning new things, solving problems. Did my first program in mid 80s, and have since explored more programming languages than I can remember (some of which have surely ceased to be used, like Basic, Pascal)
- Linux user since the early 90's, also was one of those guys tampering with OS/2 🤓

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Xtend, Java11, Maven, Mockito and how not to suck as a developer when doing it too seldom
- 💞️ Also cheating with Ardunio C++, CSS, Framework7
-
- 📫 Ping me on LinkedIn!
